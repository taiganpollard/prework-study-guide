# PreWork Study Guide 

## This is a prework study guide for students in the coding bootcamp. There are several different sections containing topics including HTML, CSS, Javascript and git that go over information learned from each one. My motivation was to create my very first webpage to display what I have learned. It solves the problem of being able to find quick information about each subject. I learned a few of the different languages I will be learning more about in the coding bootcamp, and learned how to make them work together to produce a better running and function website.

## Installation
N/A 

## Usage
The website displays different sections pertaining to each subject such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git. Each one has it's own seperate notes explaining more about each type of language and how to use them. If you open the Devtools console you can see that Javascript is running.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
