  # Prework Study Guide Webpage

## This Prework study guide webpage is a project for students of the coding bootcamp. I built this project while learning more about HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git and how to apply them all together. My motivation was learning more about them and understanding why you need each one. This helps solve the problem of beginners to coding who might not know as much, and getting a taste of how each one works individually to create a wbesite. I learned different things about HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript and how to make them all work together as one. 


If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
